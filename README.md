### Project Brief

A Java console program to perfom the following:

- Calculate kinetic energy of objects given it mass (in grams) and velocity (in m/s).
- Calculate potential energy of objects given its mass (in grams) and height(in meters) while acceleration due to gravity remains constant(g=10m/s^2)
